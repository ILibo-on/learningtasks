        <h1>About Spider-man:</h1>
        <p><font color ="#E0FFFF" ><mark>This is story about a kid, bitten by a radioactive spider who in turned become a popular super hero and due to some tragic cause he got inspired from a qoute "With great power, there must come great responsibility." and with that code he live with that vow.Regardless of the plot of the story whether it is against a villain from other universe, to fight them alone or in team, strives to save the day. To also be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.</mark></p>
    
        <p><mark>For me regardless of what specific Spider-Man movie, Spider-man is like my all time favorite super hero, it was during the first spider the 2002 version that I got so attracted to the movie that right until now I was into the Spider-man fandom.</mark></p>
      
        <p><mark>WIth his flashy costumes and fancy movements and abilities that attract me the most.But as I grow older I get to learn his motives and got inspired about it. He is quite relatable as a Peter Parker and relatable about having this responsibility in a way.</mark></p>
