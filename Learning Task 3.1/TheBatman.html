        <h2>My view to the Movie:</h2>
        <p>I'm gonna try to post my reviews while trying to avoid spoling here cause it just recently released. This movie is quite one of the best movie of the year, one of the realistic concept of the Dark Knight's story.</p>
        <p>He claims to be vengeance at first at that turn he realized he just do not show fear to the criminals but but as a warning sign. He is also a hope for the law abiding citzen. And as time goes by just like the typical plot of Batman story, I am sure he is in time will become Justice.</p>
