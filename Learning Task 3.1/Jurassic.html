        <h1>About Jurassic Park:</h1>
        <p>In Steven Spielberg's massive blockbuster, paleontologists Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) are among a select group chosen to tour an island theme park populated by dinosaurs created from prehistoric DNA. While the park's mastermind, billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), assures everyone that the facility is safe, they find out otherwise when various ferocious predators break free and go on the hunt.</p>
    
        <h1>About Jurassic World:</h1>
        <p>Located off the coast of Costa Rica, the Jurassic World luxury resort provides a habitat for an array of genetically engineered dinosaurs, including the vicious and intelligent Indominus rex. When the massive creature escapes, it sets off a chain reaction that causes the other dinos to run amok. Now, it's up to a former military man and animal expert (Chris Pratt) to use his special skills to save two young brothers and the rest of the tourists from an all-out, prehistoric assault.</p>
    
        <h2>My view to the Movie:</h2>
        <p>So I just fused all the parts of the Jurassic movie as one. I love this as a child and I love it even now. The message is like we cannot control nature. </p>
        <p>The Never-Learned Lesson In 'Jurassic World' : 13.7: Cosmos And Culture The movie's message is that, unable to learn from past mistakes, man remains morally in the caves â€” but with access to increasingly more powerful technologies, says commentator Marcelo Gleiser.</p>
