        <h1>About Movie:</h1>
        <p>(I'll just fuse the 2014 Godzilla and the 2019 Godzilla King of the Monsters all together)
        It's a monster movie about Godzilla the Alpha Titan that ruled the world where Titans roam the Planet.</p>
    
        <h1>About the Plot:</h1>
        <p>In 1954 America exploded a nuke and from the depths of the sea it awaken something, an Alpha Predator dating back from the prehistoric Era, awaken from millions of years of hibernation it happen to seek domination accross the Titan that have also awakened. Two of those were the Paraysitic Titans the Muto (Massiv Unidentified Terrestrial Object) they were a pair and if they bred they could fill the earth with their offsprings resulting in mass extinction but Godzilla won't allow it and they are on a Kaiju(Strange Monster) fight.</p>
        <p>5 years after the fight in 2014, an eco terrorist happen to stole an orca (an object that could make some titan frequency to unleash titans) they happen to awaken King Ghidorah a 3 headed aliean dragon monster that Rivals Godzilla as the Alpha on Earth unleashing a massive extinction that could trigger all Titans and go rogue.
