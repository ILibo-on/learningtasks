        <h1><div>HOW TO SOLVE A SOCIAL PROBLEM:</div></h1>
        <p>Recall the difference between a program and a process if you remember nothing else I say. A program is a solution to a problem, but a good process is a strategy for identifying solutions and applying a methodology to a variety of situations and challenges. Last November, our President, Rosanne Haggerty, told students at Amherst College, where her alma school was hosting a TEDx conference on "Disruptive Innovation," that "having a strong process is much more significant than having a good program any day."</p>
    
        <h2>Rosanne described how she went from not asking the correct questions to building a social problem-solving paradigm.</h2>
           <p>The process:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Focus on the Outliers </li>
            <li>Set  measurable goals with a scary deadline </li>
            <li>Focus on the obvious thing </li>
            <li>Build the broadest team possible </li>
            <li>Experiment in short cycles </li>
        </ul>
         <h1> So why did I relate this in solving Filipino social Issues?</h1>
        
        <ul>
           <li>First of all this is an issue we can relate to help our country's problem.</li>
            <li>If our government can try to apply this way or method to help our people this could bbe possible.</li>
            <li>We are a developing country so innovation can work to help and push everyone to progress.</li>
            <li>We just need a step by step process for this.</li>
            <li>A community with genuine concern to each and every people with open mindedness is the key.</li>
            <li>Unity is the key.</li>
        </ul>
         <h2>This can help our nation's issues to help each one also in this way we can help eliminate corruption since corruption is done by selfishness and greed.</h2>
