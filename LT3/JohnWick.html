        <h2>My view to the Movie:</h2>
        <p><mark>John wick is one entertaining movie as it shows how skilled the Character is. It is very action packed that movie watchers do enjoy the film.The action pack of the movie also looks realistic in a way as it shows some moves from different martial arts. It also show how to use firearms in a way that looks realistic as he tries to clutch up some guns in a fight.</mark></p>
