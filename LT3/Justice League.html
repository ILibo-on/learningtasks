        <h1>About Movie:</h1>
        <p>Zack Snyder's Justice League, often referred to as the "Snyder Cut", is the 2021 director's cut of the 2017 American superhero film Justice League.</p>
    
        <h1>About the Plot:</h1>
        <p>Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists newfound ally Diana Prince to face an even greater threat. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to recruit a team to stand against this newly awakened enemy. Despite the formation of an unprecedented league of heroes -- Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and the Flash -- it may be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.</p>
    
        <h2>My view to the Movie:</h2>
        <p>Snyder's Cut of Justice League has a lot more to offer, and it's well worth the four-hour length. Snyder made this film for the fans, and he delivered on his promise to continue the DCEU.</p>
