        <h1>About Movie:</h1>
        <p>Kong and his protectors undertake a perilous journey to find his true home. Along for the ride is Jia, an orphaned girl who has a unique and powerful bond with the mighty beast. However, they soon find themselves in the path of an enraged Godzilla as he cuts a swath of destruction across the globe. The initial confrontation between the two titans -- instigated by unseen forces -- is only the beginning of the mystery that lies deep within the core of the planet.</p>
    
        <h1>About the Plot:</h1>
        <p>Two Naturally rivals in the Alpha Title met due to Human greed. Their species have an ancient war back in the days. Godzilla though is not after kong, what he is after is the weapon humans created that relates with a Ghidorah Skull and that is the Mecha Godzilla.</p>
        <p>Godzilla and Kong fought, Godzilla won the bout but let Kong live in defeat, after the fight Godzilla was exhausted but still fought Mecha G, with his handicap he almost dies but due to the help of Kong they prevail.</p>
    
        <h2>My view to the Movie:</h2>
        <p>The movie is just like the 2014 and 2019 Godzilla movie, like a love letter to Godzilla fans  and King Kong Fans like me.</p>
        <p>The Story Shows that Humans think Nature is in their hands and not the way around.</p>
