        <h1>About Rurouni Kenshin:</h1>
        <p>Rurouni Kenshin (The Wanderer Kenshin or Kenshin the Wanderer) also known Samurai X is a Live Action Adaptation of the Anime with the same name, it's has four movies was originally written and drawn by Nobuhiru Watsuki.</p>
    
        <h1>About the Plot:</h1>
        <p>The story tells about the former Hitokiri also known as Assassin who pledged to never kill again after the Revolution and became a Wanderer in the peaceful times of Tokyo Meiji Era. Although he stopped killing his past tends to haunt him, not just in memory but the people from his past who survived the war. Along with him he meets people as he wanders and the main characters, Kauro, Yahiko/Yoshi, Sanosuke and Megumi will be his companion in his life, journey, retribution and adventure with his vow to help people and never kill again as he live the life in the peaceful day of Meiji Era in Japan.</p>
    
        <h2>My view to the Movie:</h2>
        <p>This is one of my top anime and when it was released as a live action movie I was so hyped and I do love the movie.</p>
        <p>The story tells about a samurai with PTSD from being a former slayer to fight his alter ego and so on. There was this qoute that I love in this story and that is "You can die at any time, but living takes true courage." that sounds apealing to me. In this world where life can be so unfair and unjust, living through the present is what matters the most no matter how dark your past is, no matter who you are used to be and what you do before. All you have to do is to get better in the present and face the future with courage and confidence.</p>
